Personally, I feel inspired whenever I open Emacs.  Like a craftsman entering
his workshop, I feel a realm of possibility open before me.  I feel the comfort
of an environment that has evolved over time to fit me perfectly -- an
assortment of packages and keybindings which help me bring ideas to life day
after day.

* About this configuration

  This file is an attempt at a literate GNU Emacs (henceforth "Emacs")
  configuration.

  Literate programming is a method in which programming is worked on in parallel
  with the development of documentation specifically pertaining to how said
  program was written, alongside how to use the program at times.  The end
  result is a file that can be /tangled/ into source code and /weaved/ into
  documentation.  The benefits of this practice are far easier maintenance of a
  rapidly growing project, and far greater control in the flow of when code is
  introduced in documentation and where it is included in resultant source code.
  This allows code to be introduced to the reader in an intuitive manner when
  reading documentation or working on code while compiling in the right order
  for a successful build.

  This configuration is /incredibly/ opinionated, and it is very likely that most
  changes will not be friendly towards the typical Emacs user.  Hopefully this
  file will contain enough commentary for you to understand everything within
  it.  Regardless, the idea is that this file, when tangled, generates my entire
  configuration.  I would /highly/ recommend you *NOT* try to read the =.el= files on
  their own.  It's a jungle, especially since all of the commentary regarding
  the configuration is in this file and this file alone.

** Okay, that's pretty neat.  Why though?

   Before I used a fully literate file, I had an =init.el= which tangled blocks
   from a =config.org= on the fly (read: on startup).  It turns out this method is
   abysmally slow, making for a startup time of around 4.5 seconds when loading
   into my desktop environment, even if saving was much faster since no tangling
   took place when saving the file, much less use of ~noweb~ causing massive
   slowdowns in the tangling process.

   Tangling blocks from a =literate-emacs.org= into byte-compiled =early-init.el=
   and =init.el=, alongside the use of portable dumping and multiple other
   efficiency improvements, cuts this time down to around 1.1 seconds to load
   into my desktop environment.  This also comes with the advantage of being a
   hub for /all/ things related to my Emacs configuration, where previously I had
   to check multiple files when I thought I might have changed something for the
   worse.

   There has been some degree more complexity in managing this configuration,
   since I am having to juggle many more moving parts which may be in different
   places of the file, but the rewards for this kind of configuration are
   significantly outweighing the minor inconveniences which come with it, as
   having things ordered as they are means shorter blocks and code and more
   documentation about what each block does.

** Installation

   1) Clone the repo into where you store your Emacs configuration.
   2) Make sure you have all the right dependencies.
      See below for more details.

** Dependencies

   #+begin_center
   *THIS CONFIGURATION IS MEANT FOR EMACS 27 AND LATER.  IT WILL LIKELY /NOT/ LOAD
   PROPERLY ON EMACS 26 OR EARLIER.  THE BRANCH FOR EMACS 26 OR EARLIER IS [[https://github.com/farlado/dotemacs/tree/emacs26-end][HERE]].*
   #+end_center

   Everything has different dependencies so make sure you have what you need.

* Giving files their headers

  In order to make the files look at least somewhat decent for documentation
  linters, and to warn those who are unfortunate enough to think they'll just
  mosey on into one of them if they want to understand the config, we create
  headers that tell people the reality of the files.

* Making Emacs start quickly

  This is everything related to starting Emacs quickly.  First things first is
  setting up a batch script used to create a custom portable dump image,
  followed by what to execute at startup to make initialization faster.

** Starting Emacs FAST
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle "pdumper.el"
   :end:

   Even with the "small" amount I ask of Emacs, it's a lot of beef to start up
   as fast as I demand it to start up.  The portable dumper is an amazing thing.
   This is just a minimal script for utilizing the portable dumper added to
   Emacs 27 to make Emacs load faster.  Every single ~require~ that doesn't create
   a =LispObject= incompatible with the portable dumper can now be skipped while
   loading.  Before I started using the portable dumper, I saw start times of
   around 2.5 seconds.  Now I am down 1.1 seconds, having cut about half of the
   start time out.

   This script must be run while Emacs is *not* open, otherwise it will *crash*
   Emacs and (if you're using ~vterm~ or another virtual terminal inside of Emacs
   to run the script) *the dump image will be corrupted*.  Currently Emacs is
   unable to create a portable dump image outside of a batch script.  To run the
   script, from the shell enter the following, substituting =$USER_EMACS_DIR= for
   wherever you store your Emacs configuration:

   #+begin_src sh :tangle no
     emacs --batch -q -l $USER_EMACS_DIR/pdumper.el
   #+end_src

*** Load packages

    Because we are wanting to load packages, first the package manager must be
    initialized.  Because creating a portable dump image is in a batch script,
    package management as a feature must be loaded manually.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (require 'package)
      (package-initialize)
    #+end_src

*** Store =load-path=

    For some reason, the dump image doesn't store =load-path=, so it needs to be
    stored here, to be restored when =early-init.el= is loaded.  A boolean is also
    set to indicate a portable dump image was used when Emacs is loaded, so that
    other fixes to erratic behavior can be applied.  See further down for
    details.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq pdumper-load-path load-path
            pdumper-dumped t)
    #+end_src

*** ~require~ features

    This is really the most important section of the script: where all the
    features in use are loaded, save those with functionality that behave
    erratically if loaded in this way.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (dolist (feature `(;; Core
                         use-package
                         async

                         try

                         wallpaper))
          (require feature))
    #+end_src

*** Pre-load the theme

    A *HUGE* amount of time is spent loading the theme during startup.  Loading
    the theme in the portable dump image saves a sizeable chunk of time.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (load-theme 'dracula t t)
    #+end_src

*** Write the dump image

    This is where the magic happens.  Sit back and relax, this can take a minute
    or few to finish up.  If it crashes here, the dump image will come out
    corrupted.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (dump-emacs-portable (locate-user-emacs-file "emacs.pdmp"))
    #+end_src

** Do these things ASAP
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle "early-init.el"
   :end:

   Emacs 27 has introduced the file =early-init.el=, allowing configuration of
   multiple items before Emacs has graphically loaded.  Either I want these
   configured as soon as possible, or they are related to Emacs starting up.
   Which are which is left as an exercise to the reader.

*** Prepare GUI (Part 1)

    I want to get GUI elements out of my face as soon as I possibly can.  They
    just take up space.  If I'm running Emacs as my desktop environment (see
    further below), I want Emacs to immediately take on the background color of
    the theme I use to make startup marginally more aesthetically pleasing.

    Seriously, who among us Emacsers even /uses/ any of the GUI bits of Emacs
    regularly anyway? Why are these here to begin with? The scroll bar makes
    some sense but still I find it pointless, since Emacs is so centered on
    keyboard use...

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (menu-bar-mode -1)
      (tool-bar-mode -1)
      (scroll-bar-mode -1)

      (when (getenv "_RUN_EXWM")
        (set-face-background 'default "#282a36"))
    #+end_src

*** Handling portable dumping

    For some reason, the portable dumper has odd behaviors.  This block aims to
    address each of these behaviors so that using a custom dump image does not
    behave any different from not using one.

    This block is supposed to:
    - Recover =load-path= from the dump image
    - Restore modes not preserved in the dump image
    - Fix the scratch buffer
    - Create a function to ~require~ a feature only if =pdumper-dumped= is nil

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defvar pdumper-dumped nil
        "Non-nil if a custom dump image was loaded.")

      (defvar pdumper-load-path nil
        "Contains `load-path' if a custom dump image was loaded.")

      (defun pdumper-require (feature &optional filename noerror)
        "Call `require' to load FEATURE if `pdumper-dumped' is nil.

      FILENAME and NOERROR are also passed to `require'."
        (unless pdumper-dumped
          (require feature filename noerror)))

      (defun pdumper-fix-scratch-buffer ()
        "Ensure the scratch buffer is properly loaded."
        (with-current-buffer "*scratch*"
          (lisp-interaction-mode)))

      (when pdumper-dumped
        (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'pdumper-fix-scratch-buffer)
        (setq load-path pdumper-load-path)
        (global-font-lock-mode 1)
        (transient-mark-mode 1)
        (blink-cursor-mode 1))
    #+end_src

*** Byte-compile on first run

    Byte-compiling the init file is surprisingly effective and helps speed up
    startup quite a bit.  It's done after =after-init-hook= so that we don't
    actually do it in the middle of loading files.  That would be disastrous.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-init/compile-user-emacs-directory ()
        "Recompile all files in `user-emacs-directory'."
        (byte-recompile-directory user-emacs-directory 0))

      (unless (file-exists-p (locate-user-emacs-file "init.elc"))
        (add-hook 'after-init-hook #'farl-init/compile-user-emacs-directory))
    #+end_src

*** Prefer the newest files

    If there's a difference in time between a file and its byte-compiled
    counterpart, prefer the newer one.  This ensures if I pull changes from
    GitHub but forget to recompile, I will still get to enjoy the changes I
    made.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq load-prefer-newer t)
    #+end_src

*** More complete apropos

    Even if it is slower, this ensures that ~apropos~ will look through /everything/
    when run.  This is helpful for ensuring that when looking for something,
    every potential option shows up.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq-default apropos-do-all t)
    #+end_src

*** File name handling setup

    For whatever reason, setting =file-name-handler-alist= to =nil= helps Emacs load
    faster.  After Emacs finishes loading, it's reverted to its original value.
    I don't even know how it works, but it does.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defvar startup/file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist
        "Temporary storage for `file-name-handler-alist' during startup.")

      (defun startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist ()
        "Revert `file-name-handler-alist' to its default value after startup."
        (setq file-name-handler-alist startup/file-name-handler-alist))

      (setq file-name-handler-alist nil)
      (add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook #'startup/revert-file-name-handler-alist)
    #+end_src

*** Garbage collection setup

    Garbage collection shouldn't happen during startup, as that will slow Emacs
    down.  Do it later.  This is also where more ideal garbage collection
    settings are chosen.  The functions used to defer and restore garbage
    collection are used later on, so they use more general names.  If my desktop
    environment is to be loaded, do not restore garbage collection too soon.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

** Early package management
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle "early-init.el"
   :end:

   Because I am writing this configuration to be as independent/portable as
   possible (e.g. I should be able to dump this onto any machine and run it), I
   manage all packages through Emacs.  All of this is done leading up to the
   call of ~package-initialize~ between loading =early-init.el= and =init.el=, which
   makes for faster loading.  Packages cannot be installed at this stage, so
   what is present here is everything leading up to the installation of
   packages.

*** Disable ~customize~, keep ~package-autoremove~ working

    I /hate/ ~customize~.  I hate it with a burning passion.  I configure everything
    in this file, so I don't need anything messing with my =init.el=, much less
    changing settings on me.  Even though I do not use ~customize~, I really like
    protecting packages used in my configuration from ~package-autoremove~, so I
    need to still set the variable =package-selected-packages= so that it'll work.
    Packages are listed in the order in which they are mentioned in this
    configuration, though this isn't guaranteed since things change all the
    time.

    #+end_src

*** Disable an annoying ~customize~ function

    Since I don't use ~customize~, we don't need to mess with it every time a
    package is installed or uninstalled.  This also ensures that
    =package-saved-packages= will never be altered by installing or removing
    packages.  Because of this, I need to first load everything related to
    package management.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (pdumper-require 'package)
      (defun package--save-selected-packages (&rest opt)
        "Return nil, ignoring OPT.

      This function was altered to inhibit a specific undesired behavior."
        nil)
    #+end_src

*** Configure package repositories

    Next, we have to add our package repositories to the list.  The GNU and
    MELPA repositories should be enough to last me decades.  This is multiple
    thousands of packages, basically everything of a quality high enough to be
    worth installing in the now.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq package-archives '(("gnu"   . "https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
                               ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
    #+end_src

** Later package management
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle "init.el"
   :end:

   This part of package management is meant to be done after ~package-initialize~
   has been called.  At this point, we can leave =early-init.el= and move into
   =init.el= to continue Emacs startup.  This is where packages can actually start
   being installed, but here we only install things directly related to
   installing and updating packages.

*** Easy configuration

    Since I manage all Emacs packages in Emacs itself, ~use-package~ makes it much
    easier to manage the packages I need.  It also means I can see what packages
    take the longest to load, alongside configure packages in a significantly
    more declarative manner rather than the weird way I've seen packages
    configured in other configurations.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
        (package-refresh-contents)
        (package-install 'use-package))

      (pdumper-require 'use-package)
      (setq use-package-compute-statistics t)
    #+end_src

*** Asynchronous execution

    Asynchronous bytecode compilation and various other actions makes Emacs lock
    SIGNIFICANTLY less often.  This is a very good thing.  Every time Emacs
    locks up that halts my whole desktop environment, so minimizing that
    happening is extremely important.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package async
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (dired-async-mode 1)
        (async-bytecomp-package-mode 1)
        :custom (async-bytecomp-allowed-packages '(all)))
    #+end_src

*** Automatic package updates

    I don't want to have to manually update my stuff.  This solution is
    literally plop-and-forget, and updates packages on a regular interval of two
    days.  It has never caused me a single problem ever.  I haven't even
    modified the package settings since I introduced it to the configuration.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package auto-package-update
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom ((auto-package-update-interval 2)
                 (auto-package-update-hide-results t)
                 (auto-package-update-delete-old-versions t))
        :hook (after-init . auto-package-update-maybe))
    #+end_src

*** Trying packages on the fly

    Sometimes I just want to give a package a shot before including it in my
    configuration and having to entirely redo my portable dump file.  This
    package allows the temporary inclusion of a package in my Emacs environment
    for a single session.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package try
        :ensure t
        :defer t)
    #+end_src
* Making Emacs much less ugly

  Stock Emacs is /ugly/.  Just straight up ugly.  Suffice to say it leaves much to
  be desired.  This ranges from unimportant things to things which make my eyes
  burn.  This section is specifically meant for fixing Emacs visually and making
  it much more desirable for everyday use.

** Font
   :properties:
   :header-args: :noweb-ref theme-init
   :end:

   Of course, a text editor needs to be able to display text well.  These
   settings are specifically meant to make text not only display properly, but
   also make it look /good/.

*** Use UTF-8 encoding

    This makes for a much easier time editing files and working with text.  Why
    isn't this the default to begin with since it's basically standard for
    everything?

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (prefer-coding-system 'utf-8)
      (setq locale-coding-system 'utf-8)
      (set-language-environment "UTF-8")
      (set-default-coding-systems 'utf-8)
      (set-terminal-coding-system 'utf-8)
      (set-keyboard-coding-system 'utf-8)
      (set-selection-coding-system 'utf-8)
    #+end_src

*** Setting the font style

    Originally I had this set up by means of ~custom-set-faces~, but frankly that
    is less easily configured than this method.  Every part of ~customize~ simply
    isn't all that useful when trying to make things easier to edit directly
    from the configuration files.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (when (member "Iosevka" (font-family-list))
        (set-face-attribute 'default nil
                            :font "Iosevka"
                            :height 100))
    #+end_src

*** Getting emoji to work properly

    This one feel great to have now that I use an Emacs version that can handle
    it!  Emoji now render properly in documents!  🐲

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (when (member "Noto Color Emoji" (font-family-list))
        (set-fontset-font t 'symbol
                          (font-spec :family "Noto Color Emoji")
                          nil 'prepend))
    #+end_src

*** Don't unload fonts when not in use

    This solves a number of hanging issues related to a number of different
    packages and symbols.  Emacs gets annoyingly slow if this is not set.  This
    is also known to prevent issues at times with other packages, so that's
    good.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq inhibit-compacting-font-caches t)
    #+end_src

** Theme

   For the longest time I thought Leuven was seriously my best choice.  As time
   has gone by, I've gotten less and less fond of Leuven.  It served me well at
   the beginning of my exploration, but after so long using dark themes and
   having wallpapers behind my Emacs, Leuven stopped cutting it.  Currently the
   theme I am using is Dracula.  This is probably the most comfortable theme I
   have found, and there are GTK themes that match it very well.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package dracula-theme
       :if window-system
       :ensure t
       :defer t
       :init
       (if pdumper-dumped
           (enable-theme 'dracula)
         (load-theme 'dracula t))
       <<theme-init>>)
   #+end_src

*** Fringes

    Having fringes helps keep things looking good and gives the opportunity to
    have nice indicators on the edges of buffers.  I prefer when fringes are the
    same color as the rest of the window, a choice which many themes seem not to
    agree with for some reason.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref theme-init
      ;(set-face-background 'fringe (face-background 'default))
      (fringe-mode 10)
    #+end_src

*** Line numbers

    For some reason, some themes like to give line numbers a different color
    background from the rest of a window.  I hate that.  It distracts me and
    looks extremely tacky.  Keeping the line numbers' background color the same
    color as the background of the rest of the window leaves little in the way
    of distractions.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref theme-init
      ;(set-face-background 'line-number (face-background 'default))
    #+end_src

*** Window dividers

    Windows dividers make Emacs look far less sloppy, and provide divisions
    between windows that are significantly more visible.  The color is grabbed
    from the mode line for consistency.  Three pixels seems to be the best
    looking width for window dividers across all my screens.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref theme-init
      (setq window-divider-default-right-width 3)
      (let ((color (face-background 'mode-line)))
        (dolist (face '(window-divider-first-pixel
                        window-divider-last-pixel
                        window-divider))
          (set-face-foreground face color)))
      (window-divider-mode 1)
    #+end_src

*** Transparent frames

    If there's a gimmick I never realized I can't get enough of, it's having a
    transparent frame.  At first, I thought it would look dumb, that it would
    make things hard to read since Emacs doesn't seem to differentiate between
    foreground and background when setting alpha values, but now that I have
    used it for a while, going back to an opaque frame seems tacky.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref theme-init
      (dolist (frame (frame-list))
        (set-frame-parameter frame 'alpha 90))
      (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(alpha . 90))
    #+end_src

*** Better Org-mode headers

    For some reason, theme creators don't really think of formatting Org-mode
    past colors, so I have instead taken matters into my own hands.  This way, I
    can use whatever color scheme I want with some peace of mind that at the
    least I don't have to look for Org-aware themes.  It also means I can
    override some of the dumber choices of Org-aware themes.  This block is
    tangled into Org-mode's ~use-package~ form rather than here.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref org-init
      (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil
                          :weight 'extra-bold
                          :height 1.8)
      (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1 nil
                          :height 1.3)
      (set-face-attribute 'org-level-2 nil
                          :height 1.1)
      (set-face-attribute 'org-level-3 nil
                          :height 1.0)
      (set-face-attribute 'org-code nil
                          :inherit 'font-lock-string-face)
    #+end_src

** Mode line

   I hate the default mode line with a burning passion.  This mode line is sleek
   and minimalist for a quick startup and a compact look and saved frustration.
   I have considered a number of other mode lines, but this one seems to be the
   most fitting for what I want.  The package ~mini-modeline~ was considered but
   comes with a number of pitfalls including but not exclusively cases in which
   the echo area will clash with the mode line.  I considered ~doom-modeline~ but
   frankly I find the icons to look weird and it is a rather tall mode line.  At
   the end of the day, ~mood-line~ provides the minimalism of ~doom-modeline~ but
   does not require the weird symbols.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package mood-line
       :ensure t
       :defer t
       :init
       (mood-line-mode 1)
       <<mode-line-init>>)
   #+end_src

*** Show line/column numbers on the mode line

    Why isn't this enabled by default on a /text editor/?  What line and column
    the point is on should always be visible on the mode line.  I don't know if
    I even need to toggle these for my given mode line, but it still seems
    productive to enable them.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref mode-line-init
      (line-number-mode 1)
      (column-number-mode 1)
    #+end_src

*** Show clock and battery level on mode line

    I used to use ~fancy-battery~ for battery level but it constantly disappeared
    on my teeny tiny screens so I just decided not to bother with it.  Plus it's
    one less package to configure lol.  The clock should be in 24-hour time, and
    the date should also be shown.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref mode-line-init
      (display-time-mode 1)
      (display-battery-mode 1)
      :custom ((display-time-format "%a %m/%d %H:%M")
               (display-time-day-and-date t)
               (display-time-24hr-format t))
    #+end_src

** Start screen

   The default screen is nice when you are first using Emacs, and it contains
   many useful links , but personally I want something with more options to
   customize.  This package provides that, and works incredibly well.  A custom
   banner is displayed and recent files are shown.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package dashboard
       :ensure t
       :defer t
       :init
       <<dashboard-init>>
       (dashboard-setup-startup-hook)
       :custom ((inhibit-start-screen t)
                (dashboard-set-footer nil)
                (dashboard-startup-banner (locate-user-emacs-file "logo.png"))
                (dashboard-items '((recents . 10)))
                (initial-buffer-choice #'dashboard-or-scratch)
                (dashboard-banner-logo-title
                 "Welcome to Farlado's Illiterate GNU Emacs!"))
       :hook (dashboard-mode . dashboard-immortal))
   #+end_src

*** Show dashboard or scratch initially

   When Emacs or ~emacsclient~ starts, the first buffer shown should be either
   dashboard or a scratch buffer.  To prevent use of a lambda (something I
   have come to try to avoid where I can for a number of good reasons).

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref dashboard-init
     (defun dashboard-or-scratch ()
       "Open either dashboard or the scratch buffer."
       (or (get-buffer "*dashboard*")
           (get-buffer "*scratch*")))
   #+end_src

*** Make the dashboard buffer immortal

   The dashboard buffer itself should be immortal.  I used to close it all the
   time, and this is meant to prevent that by hooking ~emacs-lock-mode~ into
   =dashboard-mode-hook= to lock the buffer from being killed.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref dashboard-init
     (defun dashboard-immortal ()
       "Make the dashboard buffer immortal."
       (emacs-lock-mode 'kill))

*** Word wrapping

    This is a more point of convenience than aesthetic, even in programming
    language buffers.  Wrapping words makes for a heck of a lot more readability
    of any kind of text, whether a program or just normal language.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-visual-line-mode 1)
    #+end_src

    However, I don't want to stop there.  I want to keep certain limits to how
    wide lines can go, so I also use ~auto-fill-mode~ so words will wrap as I
    type.  I personally prefer a =fill-column= value of 80 by default.  This rule
    should only apply to modes involving prose.  Configuration and programming
    buffers should not include this limitation.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq-default fill-column 80)
      (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'turn-on-auto-fill)
    #+end_src

*** Other GUI items

    These settings would be great to include in =early-init.el=, but they don't
    seem to go into effect unless they are in =init.el= instead.  What a bummer.
    Showing tooltips and dialog boxes outside of the minibuffer is utter
    nonsense and I really don't like that idea.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (tooltip-mode -1)
      (setq use-dialog-box nil
            use-file-dialog nil)
    #+end_src

*** Make the cursor a bar

    For some reason, the point as a block is just aesthetically unpleasing to
    me, and it seems to make more sense to have a thinner point so that it
    really demonstrates where precisely symbols will be inserted, instead of
    directly being /on/ a character.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq-default cursor-type 'bar)
    #+end_src

*** Turn ^L into pretty lines

    This is used in a number of places, and it makes Emacs Lisp orders of
    magnitude easier to read and organize while showing page breaks in other
    modes, or just showing some fancy lines on the screen.  Better to have it on
    all the time than never on.  I didn't know it was an external package until
    I uninstalled ~dashboard~ for a short time.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package page-break-lines
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook (after-init . global-page-break-lines-mode))
    #+end_src

*** Line numbers (on most buffers)

    I like having line numbers and indicators for lines past the EOF.  However,
    I don't like line numbers in modes where it breaks the mode.  Having
    relative lines numbers felt weird for me at first, but it's genuinely a nice
    thing to have, as it allows me to count how many lines there are between
    some item and some other item without having to do math in my head.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package display-line-numbers
        :defer t
        :custom ((indicate-empty-lines t)
                 (display-line-numbers-type 'relative))
        :hook ((text-mode
                prog-mode
                conf-mode) . display-line-numbers-mode))
    #+end_src

*** Highlight matching parentheses

    This mode helps keep parentheses in order.  Not all themes have good
    defaults for the mode, so I have to change some settings so the highlighted
    parentheses always stand out.  I also want the highlighting to show
    immediately rather than after a longer delay.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package paren
        :defer t
        :init
        (show-paren-mode 1)
        :custom-face (show-paren-match ((t (:weight extra-bold
                                            :underline t))))
        :custom ((show-paren-style 'parentheses)
                 (show-paren-delay 0.00000001)))
    #+end_src

*** Color the background of text based on the color/hex typed

    When developing or dealing with colors, this mode is incredibly useful to
    have around, so that colors codes pop out specifically with the color they
    directly represent.  However, it really only works well if loaded in a
    graphical environment.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package rainbow-mode
        :if window-system
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-mode))
    #+end_src

*** Change the color of various delimiters based on how deep they go

    This mode makes reading Lisp and other languages so much easier and helps
    show where mismatches exist.  It also makes the buffer look a little more
    colorful and in Lisp especially makes every sexp way easier to separate from
    others.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package rainbow-delimiters
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))
    #+end_src

* Making Emacs more comfortable
  :properties:
  :header-args: :tangle "init.el"
  :end:

  Anyone who has used Emacs for any period of time can attest to the fact that
  it can take a lot to make Emacs comfortable for one's use.  That is not to say
  that Emacs is /bad/, but it definitely isn't the most usable piece of software
  straight out of the box.  These settings make some of the things I personally
  dislike about defaults in Emacs somewhat better.

** General functionality

   These are items which improve Emacs overall, but aren't specific to editing
   text or major enough to go into other categories.  This includes things from
   stopping undesired behaviors to making Emacs run generally smoother.

*** Emacs server

    Having the Emacs server running allows for a lot of neat integration with
    other parts of my desktop environment.  I don't want to try to start a
    server if one is already running, though.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (pdumper-require 'server)
      (unless (server-running-p)
        (server-start))
    #+end_src

*** No more training wheels

    I'm a big boy now, no need for anyone to hold my hand.  Since I do not use
    ~customize~, this has to be set every time Emacs starts.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq disabled-command-function nil)
    #+end_src

*** Don't hang the minibuffer

    When using the minibuffer, never do garbage collection.  I'm not entirely
    certain if it's actually causing any kind of major change in how the
    minibuffer behaves, but it definitely /feels/ a little more responsive.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (add-hook 'minibuffer-setup-hook #'garbage-collect-defer)
      (add-hook 'minibuffer-exit-hook #'garbage-collect-restore)
    #+end_src

*** Always confirm closing Emacs

    I constantly kill Emacs on accident when running it in terminals, so this
    prevents me from doing that +as easily+.  Having to always confirm when I quit
    Emacs is way better than accidentally killing Emacs when I don't want to.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq confirm-kill-emacs #'yes-or-no-p)
    #+end_src

*** Make scrolling a little less crazy

    I have no clue why the mouse wheel gets acceleration, but thankfully I don't
    have to worry about that anymore.  The goal is to make scrolling more
    friendly, e.g. it always scrolls one line at a time and the cursor stays
    where it is on the display.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq scroll-margin 0
            auto-window-vscroll nil
            scroll-preserve-screen-position 1
            scroll-conservatively most-positive-fixnum
            mouse-wheel-scroll-amount '(1 ((shift) . 1))
            mouse-wheel-progressive-speed nil
            mouse-wheel-follow-mouse t)
    #+end_src

*** Use a visual bell instead of making noise

    Sound is obnoxious and it should be visibly obvious without flashing the
    frame or mode line that something has gone wrong.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
    #+end_src

*** Replace "yes or no" prompts with "y or n" prompts

    Beauty in brevity, the less keystrokes the better.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defalias 'yes-or-no-p #'y-or-n-p
        "Use `y-or-n-p' instead of a yes/no prompt.")
    #+end_src

** Completion helpers

   There are many different features to help complete everything from commands
   to sentences to paths to input method names.  These different completion
   helpers are configured in this section.

*** ~which-key~ (small menus to help with commands)

    Even as I've gotten used to Emacs key bindings, it is always nice to have
    this around so that if I want to know, I can easily see what's what.  I also
    want to see what key sequences are being entered instantaneously.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package which-key
        :custom (echo-keystrokes 0.00000001)
        :hook (after-init . which-key-mode))
    #+end_src

*** Auto-complete in documents

    This is the base package.  I changed some key bindings to make it more
    pleasant to use.  It's not just for programming anymore, as seen in the next
    block.  I don't want it to start recommending things unless I've typed more
    than three characters and let it sit for a little under a second.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package company
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom ((company-idle-delay 0.75)
                 (company-minimum-prefix-length 3))
        :hook (after-init . global-company-mode)
        :bind (:map company-active-map
               ("M-n" . nil)
               ("M-p" . nil)
               ("C-n" . company-select-next)
               ("C-p" . company-select-previous)
               ("SPC" . company-abort)))
    #+end_src

*** Auto-complete in commands

    I /love/ ~ido-mode~, but sometimes it just didn't cut it.  Instead, I use
    ~counsel~, which provides a fancier completion experience than ~ido-mode~ does
    currently.  It's also way more ubiquitous than ~ido-mode~, and is used by a
    many other packages which are useful.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
      (use-package counsel
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (ivy-mode 1)
        (counsel-mode 1)
        (setq ivy-initial-inputs-alist nil))
    #+end_src

*** Typing Emoji using Emacs

    Thanks to ~company~ above, this is possible now!  Putting a colon and
    typing something will give suggestions for matching emoji.  🎊

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package company-emoji
        :after company
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (add-to-list 'company-backends #'company-emoji))
    #+end_src

** Buffer management
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle no
   :end:

   Buffer management is done using ~ibuffer~, which is orders of magnitude more
   comfortable than other ways I've seen of managing buffers.  Packages like
   ~helm~ can probably do good, but I personally like using what's already
   available to me.  Buffer names should also be made unique.  This looks a lot
   fancier than the default behavior, and makes buffer names far easier to read
   at a glance.  I can use ~ibuffer~ for both switching buffers and listing
   buffers, so I have no need for two separate binds.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package ibuffer
       :defer t
       :init
       <<buffer-management-init>>
       <<buffer-management-custom>>
       <<buffer-management-hook>>
       :bind (("C-x b" . ibuffer)
              ("C-x C-b" . nil)
              <<buffer-management-binds>>))
   #+end_src

*** Sort buffers better

    The absolute beauty of ~ibuffer~ is the ability to split buffers up by unique
    categories.  I can have my EXWM buffers separate from my Python or Emacs
    Lisp buffers.  However, the way this is configured is a tad wonky, so it
    requires a number of different things to be put in place.

    The first thing to do is set up the function that makes ~ibuffer~ use my
    buffer category list.  This simply makes it use the "default" filter group.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref buffer-management-init
      (defun farl-ibuffer/use-default-filter-group ()
        "Switch to the intended filter group."
        (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups "default"))
    #+end_src

    This function runs during =ibuffer-mode-hook=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref buffer-management-hook
      :hook (ibuffer-mode . farl-ibuffer/use-default-filter-group)
    #+end_src

    Finally, I can set the "default" filter group.  Other variables are tangled
    into this block for a cleaner overall tangled output.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :noweb-ref buffer-management-custom
      :custom ((ibuffer-saved-filter-groups
                (quote (("default"
                         ("exwm" (and (not (name . "Firefo[x<>1-9]+$"))
                                      (or (name . "^\\*system-packages\\*$")

                                          (mode . exwm-mode))))
                         ("firefox" (name . "Firefo[x<>1-9]+$"))
                         ("emms" (or (mode . emms-playlist-mode)
                                     (mode . emms-browser-mode)
                                     (mode . emms-mode)))
                         ("ebooks" (mode . nov-mode))
                         ("magit" (name . "^magit.*:"))
                         ("dired" (or (mode . dired-mode)
                                      (mode . wdired-mode)))

                         ("org"   (mode . org-mode))
                         ("term" (mode . term-mode))
                         ("emacs" (or (name . "^\\*package.*results\\*$")

                                      (name . "^\\*info\\*$")
                                      (name . "^\\*Help\\*$")))))))
               <<buffer-management-vars>>)
    #+end_src

*** Cleaner unique buffer names

    If any files have an identical name, make each buffer name unique using a
    forward slash and a non-identical directory which contains the file.  If one
    of the buffers is killed, remove the directory name from the buffer name.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref buffer-management-vars
      (uniquify-buffer-name-style 'forward)
      (uniquify-after-kill-buffer-p t)
    #+end_src

*** Immortal blank scratch buffer

    I kill the scratch buffer way too often if I don't do this.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref buffer-management-init
      (with-current-buffer "*scratch*"
        (emacs-lock-mode 'kill))
    #+end_src

    While I'm here, I might as well also make the scratch buffer blank.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref buffer-management-vars
      (initial-scratch-message "")
    #+end_src

*** Always kill the current buffer

    I /really/ don't like that there's a whole menu just to pick what buffer to
    kill every time I press =C-x k=, rather than just killing the buffer
    currently on the screen.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref buffer-management-binds
      ("C-x k" . kill-this-buffer)
    #+end_src

** Window management
   :properties:
   :header-args: :noweb-ref window-management-init :tangle no
   :end:

   There are built-in functions for changing focus between windows, but there
   are not good built-in functions for swapping two windows and moving buffers
   between windows.  Since ~other-window~ is hot garbage, I instead use =C-x o= as a
   prefix for the commands related to moving focus or moving windows.  Other
   window managing settings are placed in this section.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref no :noweb yes :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package buffer-move
       :ensure t
       :defer t
       :init
       <<window-management-init>>
       <<window-management-vars>>
       :bind (("C-x o" . nil)
              ("C-x o w" . windmove-up)
              ("C-x o a" . windmove-left)
              ("C-x o s" . windmove-down)
              ("C-x o d" . windmove-right)
              ("C-x o C-w" . buf-move-up)
              ("C-x o C-a" . buf-move-left)
              ("C-x o C-s" . buf-move-down)
              ("C-x o C-d" . buf-move-right)
              <<window-management-binds>>))
   #+end_src

*** Focus follows mouse

    Changing focus can also be done through sloppy focus, e.g. moving the cursor
    between windows.  I hate having to click to focus a different window, so I
    would rather just have windows sloppily focus.  This has some flaws when
    using Emacs as a desktop environment, but it's still cozier than the
    alternative behavior.  It's tangled into the window management form.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-vars
      :custom ((focus-follows-mouse t)
               (mouse-autoselect-window t))
    #+end_src

*** Follow to new windows

    When forming a new window, it should be followed and ~ibuffer~ should be
    opened.  This replaces the other not particularly friendly behavior, and
    is tangled into the window management form.

    There are two functions which are used to create new windows.  The first
    spawns a new window below the current window:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun split-and-follow-below ()
        "Open a new window vertically."
        (interactive)
        (split-window-below)
        (other-window 1)
        (ibuffer))
    #+end_src

    The other function creates a new window to the right of the current one:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun split-and-follow-right ()
        "Open a new window horizontally."
        (interactive)
        (split-window-right)
        (other-window 1)
        (ibuffer))
    #+end_src

    The new functions are bound to the "default" keys for splitting the window.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-binds
      ("C-x 2" . split-and-follow-below)
      ("C-x 3" . split-and-follow-right)
    #+end_src

*** Balancing window sizes

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-binds
      ("C-c b" . balance-windows)
    #+end_src

*** Killing both the buffer and window

    I had to adjust the function which kills both the current buffer and the
    current window, because it did not cooperate with EXWM buffers.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-init :tangle no
       (defun kill-this-buffer-and-window ()
         "Perform `kill-buffer-and-window'.  Altered to accomodate `exwm-mode'."
         (interactive)
         (let ((window-to-delete (selected-window))
               (buffer-to-kill (current-buffer))
               (delete-window-hook (lambda ()
                                     (ignore-errors
                                       (delete-window)))))
           (unwind-protect
               (progn
                 (add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook delete-window-hook t t)
                 (if (kill-buffer (current-buffer))
                     ;; If `delete-window' failed before, we repeat
                     ;; it to regenerate the error in the echo area.
                     (when (eq (selected-window) window-to-delete)
                       (delete-window)))))))
    #+end_src

    This function is used in place of ~kill-buffer-and-window~ in the stock binds.
    Originally it was set to =C-x C-k=, but as it turns out this is a relatively
    important prefix key for keyboard macros.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-binds :tangle no
      ("C-x 4 0" . kill-this-buffer-and-window)
    #+end_src

*** Kill all buffers and windows at once

    A useful function for cleaning up after messy buffers that get lost is
    killing all buffers and closing all windows.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-init
      (defun kill-all-buffers-and-windows ()
        "Kill all buffers and windows."
        (interactive)
        (when (yes-or-no-p "Really kill all buffers and windows? ")
          (save-some-buffers)
          (mapc 'kill-buffer (buffer-list))
          (delete-other-windows)))
    #+end_src

    This function is bound in a prefix that I've come to like: =C-x 4=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref window-management-binds
      ("C-x 4 q" . kill-all-buffers-and-windows)
    #+end_src

** Key binds

   I have no clue where else to put these, so here they are I guess.

*** Change directory using =C-c d=

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") #'cd)
    #+end_src

*** Open Emacs configuration with =C-c e=

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun config-visit ()
        "Open the configuration file."
        (interactive)
        (find-file (locate-user-emacs-file "literate-emacs.org")))

      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c e") #'config-visit)
    #+end_src

*** Edit files as superuser using =C-x C-M-f=

    This is especially useful when I need to edit system files.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package sudo-edit
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind ("C-x C-M-f" . sudo-edit))
    #+end_src

*** No suspending Emacs on =C-z= or =C-x C-z=

    Why is this even something bound to begin with?  I really dislike this and
    when I first did it I genuinely thought I broke something.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-unset-key (kbd "C-x C-z"))
      (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
    #+end_src

* Making Emacs a good text editor
  :properties:
  :header-args: :tangle "init.el"
  :end:

  Emacs /is/ a text editor... right?  This used to be a +somewhat bigger+ mess of
  different sections, but I've been working to categorize these settings far
  better, so much of what was previously elsewhere is now set up in here.
  Everything in here /should/ be about making Emacs pleasant to use for editing
  text of various kinds.  If it isn't, I have failed.

** Additional major modes

   These are modes that enable Emacs to edit different kinds of files
   differently.  Programming major modes are further down, in the
   programming section.

*** ~markdown-mode~ (bootleg org-mode for GitHub)

    I really don't like Markdown but I have to use it.  I don't configure it
    since I do so much in Org-mode instead.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package markdown-mode
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :mode ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode))
    #+end_src

*** ~graphviz-dot-mode~ (diagram creation)

    A nice way to make diagrams.  I don't use it too much, but having it around
    is reasonably comfortable.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package graphviz-dot-mode
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :mode ("\\.dot\\'" . graphviz-dot-mode))
    #+end_src

** Personal save hooks

   When I save a file, sometimes I want specific things to be done.  These are
   the functions run during =after-save-hook=.

*** Tangle literate programming files

    I've gotten really into literate programming lately, so this makes it much
    easier to tangle files.  Every time =after-save-hook= is run, if the filename
    contains "literate" and is an org-mode file, call ~org-babel-tangle~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun tangle-literate-program ()
        "Tangle a file if it's a literate programming file."
        (interactive)
        (when (string-match-p "literate.*.org$" buffer-file-name)
          (org-babel-tangle)))

      (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'tangle-literate-program -100)
    #+end_src

*** Automatically byte-compile Emacs files

    This is meant to happen when I save my Emacs configuration, so that all
    bytecode is up to date.  It adds some time to each save, but it is worth it
    for never having to recompile my Emacs configuration manually again.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun byte-compile-config-files ()
        "Byte-compile Emacs configuration files."
        (when (string-match-p "literate-emacs.org" (buffer-file-name))
          (byte-recompile-directory user-emacs-directory 0)))

      (add-hook 'after-save-hook #'byte-compile-config-files 100)
    #+end_src

** General editing

   These settings are kinda a "miscellaneous" collection of things I don't think
   fit within other categories of this configuration.  In due time, I may be
   able to figure out what to do with these to make it a slightly less disparate
   collection of things.

*** Word counter

    For getting a general word count.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-=") #'count-words)
    #+end_src

*** Spell-checking

    This is just a useful little tool to check spelling while editing a buffer.
    It's only configured if ~aspell~ is installed.  It's not super great, but it
    does the trick well enough for me.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package flyspell
        :if (executable-find "aspell")
        :defer t
        :custom ((ispell-program-name "aspell")
                 (ispell-dictionary "american"))
        :hook ((flyspell-mode . flyspell-buffer)
               ((prog-mode
                 conf-mode) . flyspell-prog-mode)
               (text-mode . flyspell-mode)))
    #+end_src

*** Better search behavior

    This search behavior is *SO* much nicer than the default.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package swiper
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind ("C-s" . swiper))
    #+end_src

*** No backups or auto-saving

    I love living on the edge.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq backup-inhibited t
            make-backup-files nil
            auto-save-default nil
            auto-save-list-file-prefix nil)
    #+end_src

*** Automatically revert files on change

    This way if files get modified in the middle of editing them, I don't
    overwrite the changes.  This can also change ~dired~ and ~ibuffer~ buffers if I
    am not mistaken.  However, I don't need to hear every last thing about it.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package autorevert
        :defer t
        :init
        (global-auto-revert-mode 1)
        :custom ((global-auto-revert-non-file-buffers t)
                 (auto-revert-remote-files t)
                 (auto-revert-verbose nil)))
    #+end_src

*** End-of-file newlines and indent tabs

    Screw indent tabs, spaces all the way.  Also, if there is no end-of-file
    newline, add it.  Things that help me keep my files nice and clean.  Tabs
    should probably also be significantly less wide.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq require-final-newline t)
      (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil
                    tab-width 4)
    #+end_src

*** Manage the kill ring using a pop-up menu

    Having the whole kill ring easy to scroll through is much less hassle than
    default behavior.  We also set up some yanking behavior while we're at it.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package popup-kill-ring
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom ((save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t)
                 (mouse-drag-copy-region t)
                 (mouse-yank-at-point t))
        :bind ("M-y" . popup-kill-ring))
    #+end_src

*** Delete whatever is selected if typing starts

    This is to reflect behavior in other programs.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (delete-selection-mode 1)
    #+end_src

*** Hungrily remove all whitespace when deleting

    This saves me tons of time when it comes to managing whitespace.  Instead of
    having to repeatedly press delete or backspace, a single keystroke decimates
    all the whitespace between the point and whatever is in the direction the
    deletion happens.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package hungry-delete
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (global-hungry-delete-mode 1))
    #+end_src

*** Move around visible portions of files faster

    If I want to hop around in a document without calling swiper, ~avy~ is
    definitely the way to go.  I admittedly don't use it too much, but it
    definitely has its place when editing text.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package avy
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind ("M-s" . avy-goto-char))
    #+end_src

*** Move between SubWords as well as between words

    This allows for much easier navigation between words when in programming
    language buffers, but also has utility outside of programming so it's
    enabled globally.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-subword-mode 1)
    #+end_src

*** electric-pair-mode (OH MY GOD THIS IS SO GREAT)

    I have no words for how convenient this has been and how much faster I get
    things done thanks to these six lines of elisp.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package elec-pair
        :defer t
        :init
        (electric-pair-mode 1)
        (minibuffer-electric-default-mode 1)
        :custom (electric-pair-pairs '((?\{ . ?\})
                                       (?\( . ?\))
                                       (?\[ . ?\])
                                       (?\" . ?\"))))
    #+end_src

** Programming

   It's slowly growing, but I still truly do not need all that much when it
   comes to programming, mostly because I don't actually do all that much
   programming outside what I do for fun... and editing this file.

*** Git

    I used to use a terminal for version control, but this is a lot easier, a
    lot faster, and a whole lot nicer to use overall.  It binds to =C-x g= by
    default but only if you load the package right away, so I force it to be
    bound here.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package magit
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind ("C-x g" . magit-status))
    #+end_src

*** Haskell

    I have started to mess around with Haskell, so I needed to grab a mode for
    that.  This supplies basically everything I need as far as I know, e.g.
    company autocomplete and ~flycheck~ information.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package haskell-mode
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom (haskell-stylish-on-save t)
        :hook ((haskell-mode . interactive-haskell-mode)
               (haskell-mode . haskell-doc-mode)
               (haskell-mode . haskell-indentation-mode)
               (haskell-mode . haskell-auto-insert-module-template)))
    #+end_src

*** Common Lisp

    SBCL seems to be the typical Common Lisp implementation people use, so using
    it seems to be the best thing to do.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package lisp-mode
        :defer t
        :custom (inferior-lisp-program "sbcl"))
    #+end_src

*** Python autocomplete

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package company-jedi
        :after company
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-jedi))
    #+end_src

*** On-the-fly syntax checking

    This is nice to have so I can be told right away when something's wrong.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package flycheck
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook (prog-mode . flycheck-mode))
    #+end_src

*** On-the-fly Emacs package linting

    Now that I'm dabbling in writing Emacs packages, I need to be able to lint
    packages more thoroughly.  Adding a linter specifically for packages is very
    comfy and cool and good.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package flycheck-package
        :after flycheck
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (flycheck-package-setup))
    #+end_src

*** Move ~flycheck~ issues out of the minibuffer

    I want errors to be in their own area, not polluting the minibuffer.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package flycheck-posframe
        :if window-system
        :after flycheck
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom ((posframe-mouse-banish nil)
                 (flycheck-posframe-position 'window-bottom-left-corner))
        :hook ((flycheck-mode . flycheck-posframe-mode)
               (flycheck-posframe-mode . flycheck-posframe-configure-pretty-defaults)))
    #+end_src

*** ~avy~-style navigation but between syntax errors

    This one is *SUPER COOL*.  Being able to jump straight to a problem is comfy.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package avy-flycheck
        :after flycheck
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind (:map prog-mode-map
               ("C-c C-'" . avy-flycheck-goto-error)))
    #+end_src

** Org-mode
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle no :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-init
   :end:

   As I spend more time in Org-mode, the more I need from it.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref no :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package org
       :defer t
       :init
       (pdumper-require 'org)
       <<org-init>>
       <<org-custom>>
       <<org-hook>>
       <<org-binds>>)
   #+end_src

*** Table of Contents

    This automates creating the table of contents for an Org-mode document.  It
    also works in ~markdown-mode~ too if I ever have to use Markdown.  The table
    of contents for this configuration is one such table of contents from this
    package.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package toc-org
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook ((org-mode . toc-org-mode)
               (markdown-mode . toc-org-mode)))
    #+end_src

*** Fancier bullet points

    It's kinda slow, but bullet points are very nice, better than asterisks.  It
    makes the document look much cleaner overall, and gives the bullet points
    more space away from the start of the line as they get deeper and deeper.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package org-bullets
        :if window-system
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook (org-mode . org-bullets-mode))
    #+end_src

*** Presentations in Emacs

    It's gonna need more polish, but it works for what I need it to do.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package epresent
        :if window-system
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind (:map org-mode-map
               ("C-c r" . epresent-run)))
    #+end_src

*** Quality-of-life settings

    These are just quick things that make ~org-mode~ much more visually pleasing
    and much easier to use.  Other settings are pulled into here for a cleaner
    tangle.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :noweb-ref org-custom
      :custom ((org-pretty-entities t)
               (org-src-fontify-natively t)
               (org-agenda-use-time-grid nil)
               (org-fontify-done-headline t)
               (org-src-tab-acts-natively t)
               (org-enforce-todo-dependencies t)
               (org-fontify-whole-heading-line t)
               (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)
               (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)
               (org-fontify-quote-and-verse-blocks t)
               (org-src-window-setup 'current-window)
               (org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex))
               (org-ellipsis (if window-system "⤵" "..."))
               (org-hide-emphasis-markers window-system)
               <<org-vars>>)
    #+end_src

*** Evaluating Graphviz blocks

    Since obviously dot snippets are purely harmless +as far as I know+, I just
    don't bother with having to confirm evaluation every time I try to update a
    graphic.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages '((dot . t)))
    #+end_src

*** Execute some code without having to confirm

    Since obviously dot snippets are purely harmless +as far as I know+, I just
    don't bother with having to confirm evaluation every time I try to update a
    graphic.  I also don't need to confirm evaluation of snippets in use in my
    literate files.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-org/confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
        "Don't ask to evaluate graphviz blocks or literate programming blocks."
        (not (or (string= lang "dot")
                 (string-match-p "literate.*.org$" buffer-file-name))))
    #+end_src

    The variable for confirming whether to evaluate a block is set alongside the
    other quality-of-life settings listed above.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref org-vars
      (org-confirm-babel-evaluate #'farl-org/confirm-babel-evaluate)
    #+end_src

*** Automatically fix inline images generated by code blocks

    Since some code will generate images as their result, it is important for
    those images to be shown after executing the code.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref org-hooks
      (org-babel-after-execute . org-redisplay-inline-images)
    #+end_src

*** Shortcuts for various snippets

    First, we load ~org-tempo~, the extension that allows the old way of doing
    things, and add it to =org-modules=.  Then, we add shortcuts for the
    individual blocks of code.  Finally, we can add shortcuts for other items
    that aren't blocks.  I've grown somewhat fond of this way of organizing my
    shortcuts, because it separates the blocks from the one-liners.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package org-tempo
        :defer t
        :init
        (add-to-list 'org-modules 'org-tempo)
        :custom ((org-structure-template-alist '(;; General blocks
                                                 ("c" . "center")
                                                 ("C" . "comment")
                                                 ("e" . "example")
                                                 ("q" . "quote")
                                                 ("v" . "verse")

                                                 ;; Export blocks
                                                 ("a"   . "export ascii")

*** Don't give angle brackets syntax

    For some reason, starting with ~org-mode~ 9.3 or so, all symbols that are
    brackets, i.e. ={}=, =()=, =<>=, are given syntax as pairs.  This isn't a problem
    on its own (especially since it makes quotations and parentheses far easier
    to work with), but /angle brackets specifically/ cause issues since they
    specifically are inequality operators in my books and =<= is the prefix for
    the shortcuts provided by ~org-tempo~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-org/disable-angle-bracket-syntax ()
        "Disable angle bracket syntax."
        (modify-syntax-entry ?< ".")
        (modify-syntax-entry ?> "."))
    #+end_src

    This function is hooked in =org-mode-hook=.  Other hooks are pulled into here
    for a significantly cleaner tangle.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref org-hook
      :hook ((org-mode . farl-org/disable-angle-bracket-syntax)
             <<org-hooks>>)

*** Agenda (only enabled if an agenda is found)

    I store my agendas in =$HOME/agendas=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun open-agenda-file ()
        "Open the agenda file."
        (interactive)
        (find-file (ivy-read
                    "Open agenda: "
                    (all-completions "" org-agenda-files))))
    #+end_src

    The agendas are added to a list stored in the variable =org-agenda-files=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-vars
      (org-agenda-files (when (file-directory-p "~/agendas")
                          (directory-files-recursively
                           "~/agendas" ".org$" nil)))
    #+end_src

    I open the agenda with =C-c M-a= and open a specific agenda file with =C-c s-a=.
    These are the only binds done in this entire section.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref org-binds

* Making Emacs more than an editor
  :properties:
  :header-args: :tangle "init.el"
  :end:

  Emacs is also more than just an editor, right?  There is a ton more that Emacs
  can do than just edit my text, and I want to take advantage of that.  If it
  isn't about editing text but also isn't a major thing, it will probably be
  found in here.

** Minimally configured

   These are features which require minimal configuration.  Some may be more
   important than others, but these are mostly minimally configured features.

*** Calendar

    I don't use the calendar for too much, but having it bound is nice.  Also
    important is that weeks start on Monday.  I've thought of trying to set up
    more when it comes to the calendar, but I don't know if it's really worth
    it.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (setq calendar-week-start-day 1)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-c l") #'calendar)
    #+end_src

*** Reading ebooks

    Not the best way to do epub reading, but at least it's in Emacs.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package nov
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom (nov-text-width 80)
        :mode ("\\.epub\\'" . nov-mode))
    #+end_src

*** File management

    The only thing I don't like about ~dired~ is that it doesn't list directories
    first by default.  That is done by changing the switches given to ~ls~ when
    listing contents of a directory.  I also prefer being able to edit file
    permissions through ~dired~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package wdired
        :defer t
        :custom ((dired-listing-switches "-alh --group-directories-first")
                 (wdired-allow-to-change-permissions t)))
    #+end_src

*** Terminal emulator

    I've jumped between ~ansi-term~ and ~vterm~ over and over and over but it seems
    like the best path is to just stick to ~ansi-term~, thanks to some of the more
    useful stuff it can do.  I don't really like that it doesn't automatically
    use my default shell, so I wrote my way around that with advice.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes
      (use-package term
        :defer t
        :init
        (defun farl-term/use-shell (force-bash)
          "Force `term' to use the default shell, ignoring FORCE-BASH."
          (interactive (list (getenv "SHELL"))))
        (advice-add 'ansi-term :before #'farl-term/use-shell)
        :bind ("C-c t" . ansi-term))
    #+end_src

*** Manual page reader

    Wow, there's actually an Emacs mode for this!  I put these into the =C-h=
    binds, since it is a way of getting help, after all.  If for some reason ~man~
    isn't working, ~woman~ can still grab a manpage without calling ~man~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-h 4 m") #'man)
      (global-set-key (kbd "C-h 4 w") #'woman)
    #+end_src

*** Weather information

    Picking a service to use for this was a pain.  I ended up settling for
    wttrin because it is the fastest and easiest to use, and plays nice with my
    setup.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package wttrin
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :custom (wttrin-default-cities '("Indianapolis"))
        :bind ("C-c w" . wttrin))
    #+end_src

*** System package management

    This one is a pleasant surprise to have honestly.  Having Emacs handle
    system packages as well as its own makes life a million times easier.  Since
    I use ~yay~ on Arch, I configure an entry for it and use it if it's installed.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package system-packages
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (when (executable-find "yay")
          (pdumper-require 'system-packages)
          (add-to-list 'system-packages-supported-package-managers
                       '(yay .
                             ((default-sudo . nil)
                              (install . "yay -S")
                              (search . "yay -Ss")
                              (uninstall . "yay -Rs")
                              (update . "yay -Syu")
                              (clean-cache . "yay -Sc")
                              (log . "car /var/log/pacman.log")
                              (get-info . "yay -Qi")
                              (get-info-remote . "yay -Si")
                              (list-files-provided-by . "yay -Ql")
                              (verify-all-packages . "yay -Qkk")

          (setq system-packages-use-sudo nil

    #+end_src

** Multimedia system
   :properties:
   :header-args: :tangle no
   :end:

   I am big on doing as much in Emacs as possible.  Having my music player moved
   to Emacs was a HUGE step.  When I first started using it, it was weird, but
   now I have come to absolutely love it.  It's only configured if ~mpd~ is found.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :tangle "init.el"
     (use-package emms
       :if (executable-find "mpd")
       :ensure t
       :defer t
       :init
       <<emms-init>>
       <<emms-vars>>
       <<emms-keys>>)
   #+end_src

*** Loading

    For the package to be properly configured, first everything about it has to
    be properly loaded.  This loads the necessary files to ensure ~emms~ starts
    properly, and configures it to use any music player it finds.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref emms-init
      (pdumper-require 'emms-setup)
      (require 'emms-player-mpd)
      (emms-all)
    #+end_src

*** Functions
    :properties:
    :header-args: :noweb-ref emms-init
    :end:

    In order to directly control ~mpd~, some functions have to be defined.  A
    fourth function is included to fix up a behavior I don't really like.

**** Starting the daemon

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (defun mpd/start-music-daemon ()
         "Start MPD, connect to it and sync the metadata cache"
         (interactive)
         (shell-command "mpd")
         (mpd/update-database)
         (emms-player-mpd-connect)
         (emms-cache-set-from-mpd-all)
         (message "MPD started!"))
     #+end_src

**** Stopping the daemon

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (defun mpd/kill-music-daemon ()
         "Stop playback and kill the music daemon."
         (interactive)
         (emms-stop)
         (call-process "killall" nil nil nil "mpd")
         (message "MPD killed!"))
     #+end_src

**** Updating the database

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (defun mpd/update-database ()
         "Update the MPD database synchronously."
         (interactive)
         (call-process "mpc" nil nil nil "update")
         (message "MPD database updated!"))
     #+end_src

**** Shuffling the playlist

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (defun farl-emms/shuffle-with-message ()
         "Shuffle the playlist and say so in the echo area."
         (interactive)
         (emms-shuffle)
         (message "Playlist has been shuffled."))
     #+end_src

*** Keybindings
  
    Making a keymap was a mistake.  This is so much comfier and looks a lot
    nicer when using ~which-key~, and does not require the creation of an entire
    keymap.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref emms-keys
      :bind (;; Opening playlist and music browser
             ("C-c a v" . emms)
             ("C-c a b" . emms-smart-browse)

             ;; Track navigation
             ("C-c a C-n" . emms-next)
             ("C-c a C-p" . emms-previous)
             ("C-c a p" . emms-pause)
             ("C-c a C-s" . emms-stop)

             ;; Repeat/shuffle
             ("C-c a C-r" . emms-toggle-repeat-track)
             ("C-c a r" . emms-toggle-repeat-playlist)
             ("C-c a s" . farl-emms/shuffle-with-message)

             ;; Refreshing the emms cache
             ("C-c a c" . emms-player-mpd-update-all-reset-cache)

             ;; mpd related functions
             ("C-c a d" . mpd/start-music-daemon)
             ("C-c a q" . mpd/kill-music-daemon)
             ("C-c a u" . mpd/update-database))
    #+end_src

*** Configuring

    This is where ~emms~ is configured to use ~mpd~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref emms-vars
      :custom ((emms-seek-seconds 5)
               (emms-player-list '(emms-player-mpd))
               (emms-info-functions '(emms-info mpd))
               (emms-completing-read #'ivy-completing-read)
               (emms-player-mpd-server-name "localhost")
               (emms-player-mpd-server-port "6601"))
    #+end_src

    A couple environment variables are also set.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref emms-init
      (setenv "MPD_HOST" "localhost")
      (setenv "MPD_PORT" "6601")
    #+end_src

** Games

   I also use Emacs to play games and do other fun things.  Using ~swiper~ means I
   don't need too many search functions bound, so I can bind the games prefix to
   =C-c g= without breaking too much of my workflow.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (global-unset-key (kbd "C-c g"))
   #+end_src

*** Yahtzee

    Fun dice game.  Now I can get mad at Emacs instead of my sister.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package yahtzee
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind ("C-c g y" . yahtzee))
    #+end_src

*** Sudoku

    I /love/ sudoku puzzles.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package sudoku
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :bind ("C-c g s" . sudoku))
    #+end_src

*** Tetris

    Tetris is my childhood.  No way I wouldn't set it up to be nice and comfy.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package tetris
        :defer t
        :bind (("C-c g t" . 'tetris)
               :map tetris-mode-map
               ("w" . tetris-move-bottom)

               ([right] . tetris-rotate-prev)
               ([?\t] . tetris-pause-game)
               ("r" . tetris-start-game)
               ("e" . tetris-end-game)))
    #+end_src

*** Chess

    Just for fun.  I suck at chess but it's nice to have.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

        :defer t
        :bind ("C-c g c" . chess))
    #+end_src

*** 2048

    A simple and fun game.  Was a big deal when I was in high school.  I still
    play it from time to time, to pass the time and remember my powers of 2.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package 2048-game

  Yes, you read that header right.  Emacs can be my *entire desktop environment*.
  It manages and launches X applications, it manages input for these windows, it
  controls the volume and backlight level, it manages my wallpapers, and it does
  a hell of a lot more as well.  You should probably remove this section if you
  don't plan to use Emacs as your desktop environment.

  Including it doesn't have any disadvantages though, since it only loads if an
  environment variable =_RUN_EXWM= exists, which it promptly unsets.  Make a note
  of this when writing your =.xinitrc= or writing a =.desktop= file to load Emacs as
  your desktop environment.  EXWM should replace the current window manager.

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref no :tangle "init.el"
    (use-package exwm
      :if (getenv "_RUN_EXWM")
      :ensure t
      :defer t
      :init
      (setenv "_RUN_EXWM")
      <<exwm-init>>
      :custom ((exwm-replace t)
               <<exwm-vars>>)
      <<exwm-hook>>
      <<exwm-bind>>)
  #+end_src

** X window management

   These settings specifically relate to how X application buffers are handled
   by EXWM.  It does a very good job of managing windows, so very little has to
   be done here to get it to my personal tastes.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (pdumper-require 'exwm)
     (pdumper-require 'exwm-xim)
     (pdumper-require 'exwm-randr)
     (pdumper-require 'exwm-config)
     (pdumper-require 'exwm-systemtray)
   #+end_src

*** Name EXWM buffers after the window title

    This was annoying when I first installed EXWM.  Thankfully it's easy to fix.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-exwm/name-buffer-after-window-title ()
        "Rename the current `exwm-mode' buffer after the X window's title."
        (exwm-workspace-rename-buffer exwm-title))
    #+end_src

    We hook setting the buffer name into when EXWM picks up a change in the
    window title, aptly titled =exwm-update-title-hook=.  Other hooks are pulled
    into this block for a cleaner tangle.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-hook
      :hook ((exwm-update-title . farl-exwm/name-buffer-after-window-title)
             <<exwm-hooks>>)
    #+end_src

*** Configure floating window borders

    Uses the same color as my mode line, uses the same width as window dividers.
    For whatever reason, when changed via ~customize-set-variable~ these will
    break statup.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-init
      (setq exwm-floating-border-width window-divider-default-right-width
            exwm-floating-border-color (face-background 'mode-line))
    #+end_src

** Workspace configuration

   There is much more needed to get workspaces properly configured than to set
   up window management.  Each workspace tries to load on a given monitor, and
   will otherwise load on the primary (or first) monitor.  Windows can be moved
   into different workspaces, and windows can also be automatically spawned on a
   given workspace rather than the current one.

*** Name workspaces intuitively

    The variable =farl-exwm/workspace-names= is used to provide a list of
    workspace names to be used by the function that follows.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defvar farl-exwm/workspace-names '("" "" "" "" ""
                                          "" "" "" "" "")
        "The names assigned to workspaces through `exwm-workspace-index-map'.")
    #+end_src

    The function ~farl-exwm/workspace-index-map~ returns the name of the currently
    selected workspace by the value in =farl-exwm/workspace-names=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-exwm/workspace-index-map (index)
        "Return either a workspace name for a given INDEX or INDEX itself."
        (or (elt farl-exwm/workspace-names index) index))
    #+end_src

    The variable =exwm-workspace-index-map= points to the function used to
    determine the names of workspaces.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-vars
      (exwm-workspace-index-map #'farl-exwm/workspace-index-map)
    #+end_src

*** Persistent list of workspaces

    Because I now use so many workspaces, I need to be able to see what
    workspace I am currently on.  This makes it easier to do that.  It's rather
    buggy at times, but it does what it needs to do.  A function is used to grab
    the current state of the workspaces.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package minibuffer-line
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        (defun farl-exwm/list-workspaces ()
          "List EXWM workspaces."
          (exwm-workspace--update-switch-history)
          (elt exwm-workspace--switch-history
               (exwm-workspace--position exwm-workspace--current)))
        :custom-face (minibuffer-line ((t (:inherit default))))
        :custom (minibuffer-line-format '((:eval (farl-exwm/list-workspaces))))
        :hook ((exwm-init . minibuffer-line-mode)
               (exwm-workspace-switch . minibuffer-line--update)))
    #+end_src

*** Load all workspaces on startup

    I do not want to have to load all of them individually on my own...

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-vars
      (exwm-workspace-number 10)
    #+end_src

*** Assign workspaces to monitors

    This section ensures that workspaces are placed on the right monitors. I
    have been having some issues though, inexplicably.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-vars
      (exwm-randr-workspace-monitor-plist '(0 "DisplayPort-2"
                                            1 "HDMI-A-0"
                                            2 "DisplayPort-2"
                                            3 "HDMI-A-0"
                                            4 "DisplayPort-2"
                                            5 "HDMI-A-0"
                                            6 "DisplayPort-2"
                                            7 "HDMI-A-0"
                                            8 "HDMI-A-0"
                                            9 "DisplayPort-2"))
    #+end_src

*** Assign programs to workspaces

    ...and also have some launch floating and/or without a mode line or borders.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-vars
      (exwm-manage-configurations '(((string= exwm-class-name "Steam")
                                     workspace 9
                                     floating t)
                                    ((string= exwm-class-name "hl2_linux")
                                     floating-mode-line nil)
                                    ((string= exwm-class-name "TelegramDesktop")
                                     workspace 8)
                                    ((string= exwm-class-name "discord")
                                     workspace 7)
                                    ((or (string-match-p "libreoffice"
                                                         exwm-class-name)
                                         (string= exwm-class-name "MuseScore3")
                                         (string= exwm-class-name "Gimp"))
                                     workspace 6)
                                    ((string= exwm-title "Event Tester")
                                     floating-mode-line nil
                                     floating t)))
    #+end_src

*** Cycle forward and backward workspaces

    In order to prevent the creation of additional workspaces, moving too far
    forward or back is prevented.  This allows easier movement between
    workspaces by their relation to other workspaces, rather than having to pick
    a specific number.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-exwm/workspace-next ()
        "Move forward one workspace."
        (interactive)
        (if (< exwm-workspace-current-index (1- exwm-workspace-number))
            (exwm-workspace-switch (1+ exwm-workspace-current-index))
          (message "No next workspace.")))

      (defun farl-exwm/workspace-prev ()
        "Move to the previous workspace."
        (interactive)
        (if (> exwm-workspace-current-index 0)
            (exwm-workspace-switch (1- exwm-workspace-current-index))
          (message "No previous workspace.")))
    #+end_src

** Multi-head configuration

   Thankfully, EXWM comes with hooks to handle when monitors are connected and
   disconnected, so I can do monitor configuration entirely in Emacs Lisp.  I
   have two laptops: a ThinkPad X230 and a ThinkPad W541.  Each has different
   displays and is used for different purposes.

*** Getting the currently connected monitors

    The first thing to do is set up a function to return a list of currently
    connected monitors.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun get-connected-monitors ()
        "Return a list of the currently connected monitors."
        (split-string
         (shell-command-to-string
          "xrandr | grep ' connected ' | awk '{print $1}'")))
    #+end_src

*** Configuring monitor arrangement on my X230

    This one is straightforward.  I never do any kind of split-monitor setup on
    my ThinkPad X230, so every monitor looks over the same screen.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun display-setup ()
        "Set up the connected monitors on a ThinkPad X230."
        (let ((monitors (get-connected-monitors))
              (possible '("DisplayPort-2"
                          "HDMI-A-0")))
          (dolist (monitor possible)
            (if (member monitor monitors)
                (if (string= monitor "HDMI-A-0")
                    (start-process "xrandr" nil "xrandr"
                                   "--output" monitor
                                   "--mode" "1920x1080"
                                   "--pos" "1920x0")
                  (start-process "xrandr" nil "xrandr"
                                 "--output" monitor
                                 "--mode" "1920x1080"
                                 "--pos" "0x0"
                                 "--primary"))
              (start-process "xrandr" nil "xrandr"
                             "--output" monitor
                             "--off")))))
    #+end_src

*** Configuring peripherals while docked

    Because I use a dock on my W541, there are some things I need to do
    alongside setting up my monitors.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun peripheral-setup ()
        "Configure peripherals I connect to my dock."
        (interactive)
        ;; Trackball
        (let ((trackball-id (shell-command-to-string
                             (concat "xinput | grep ELECOM | head -n 1 "
                                     "| sed -r 's/.*id=([0-9]+).*/\\1/' | "
                                     "tr '\\n' ' '"))))
          (start-process-shell-command
           "Trackball Setup" nil (concat "xinput set-prop " trackball-id
                                         "'libinput Button Scrolling Button' "
                                         "10"))
          (start-process-shell-command
           "Trackball Setup" nil (concat "xinput set-prop " trackball-id
                                         "'libinput Scroll Method Enabled' "
                                         "0 0 1"))
          (start-process-shell-command
           "Trackball Setup" nil (concat "xinput set-button-map " trackball-id
                                         "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 2 1 2")))
        ;; Keyboard
        (start-process "Keyboard Setup" nil "setxkbmap"
                       "-option" "ctrl:nocaps"))
    #+end_src

*** Bringing it all together

    Finally, I can make my generic display-and-dock setup function.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun display-update ()
        "Configure displays and dock if applicable."
        (interactive)
        (unless (get-process "Monitor Settings")
          (display-setup)
          (peripheral-setup)))
    #+End_src

    Every time EXWM detects a change in the monitors connected or active, this
    function should be called, so it's hooked to =exwm-randr-screen-change-hook=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-hooks
      (exwm-randr-screen-change . display-and-dock-setup)
    #+end_src

** X applications

   In order to create key bindings to launch X applications, first functions
   must be written which launch these X applications.

*** GIMP

    Until GIMP's functionality gets merged into Emacs, guess I'm stuck with it.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-gimp ()
        "Start GIMP."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "GIMP" nil "gimp"))
    #+end_src

*** Steam

    Gaming is possible with EXWM, if you run games windowed.  I used to run it
    floating, but honestly just having it tile is so much easier to manage.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-steam ()
        "Start Steam."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Steam" nil "steam"))
    #+end_src

*** Firefox

    Firefox has some unique abilities when it comes to how to make windows
    behave which work better for me.  I don't use tabs, and I don't want
    anything to do with them, and Firefox lets me hide the tab bar and force all
    tabs to actually open as new windows.  It's like Suckless Surf, but +not made
    by Nazis+ orders of magnitude faster and more comfortable and has a proper
    address bar.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-firefox ()
        "Start Firefox."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Firefox" nil "firefox"))
    #+end_src

*** Discord

    It's kinda trashy but my friends use it.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-discord ()
        "Start Discord."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Discord" nil "discord"))
    #+end_src

*** Telegram

    Another trashy messenger my friends use.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-telegram ()
        "Start Telegram."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Telegram" nil "telegram-desktop"))
    #+end_src

*** MuseScore

    I haven't figured out how to engrave in Emacs, so for now...

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-musescore ()
        "Start MuseScore."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "MuseScore" nil "musescore"))
    #+end_src

*** LibreOffice

    Shame me all you want.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-libreoffice ()
        "Start LibreOffice."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "LibreOffice" nil "libreoffice"))
    #+end_src

*** Transmission

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun run-transmission ()
        "Start Transmission."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Transmission" nil "transmission-gtk"))
    #+end_src

** DE components

   Of course, window management isn't all you need for a complete desktop
   environment.  Functions to provide more key binds for vital settings and
   other fun goodies are included in this section.

*** ~desktop-environment-mode~

    Previously I had to define a lot of functions to do these things, now I just
    change settings within ~desktop-environment-mode~.

    The way ~desktop-environment-mode~ passes its keys through EXWM's mode is one
    of two options: either the keys are directly bound to =exwm-mode-map=, or the
    keys are added to EXWM's prefix key set.  I prefer the latter, because it
    means the keys associated with ~desktop-environment-mode~ will be properly
    unbound when the mode is toggled off.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package desktop-environment
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :init
        <<de-init>>
        :custom ((desktop-environment-update-exwm-global-keys :prefix)
                 <<de-vars>>)
        :hook (exwm-init . desktop-environment-mode)
        :bind (:map desktop-environment-mode-map
               <<de-binds>>))
    #+end_src

**** Brightness adjustment

     This one is the simplest: all I needed to do was change the increment and
     decrement values.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-vars
       (desktop-environment-brightness-normal-increment "5%+")
       (desktop-environment-brightness-normal-decrement "5%-")
     #+end_src

**** Volume adjustment

     The only things I really don't like about how ~desktop-environment~'s volume
     controlling is ~desktop-environment-toggle-mute~, which gives way too much
     output when you mute or unmute the speakers or microphone, so I set up
     basic scripts to give much more concise output.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-vars
       (desktop-environment-volume-toggle-command
        (concat "[ \"$(amixer set Master toggle | grep off)\" ] "
                "&& echo Volume is now muted. | tr '\n' ' ' "
                "|| echo Volume is now unmuted. | tr '\n' ' '"))
       (desktop-environment-volume-toggle-microphone-command
        (concat "[ \"$(amixer set Capture toggle | grep off)\" ] "
                "&& echo Microphone is now muted. | tr '\n' ' ' "
                "|| echo Microphone is now unmuted | tr '\n' ' '"))
     #+end_src

**** Lock screen

     Haha yes, this is very long and very very stupid.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-vars
       (desktop-environment-screenlock-command
        (concat "i3lock -nk --color=000000 --timecolor=ffffffff "
                "--datecolor=ffffffff --wrongcolor=ffffffff "
                "--ringcolor=00000000 --insidecolor=00000000 "
                "--keyhlcolor=00000000 --bshlcolor=00000000 "
                "--separatorcolor=00000000 --ringvercolor=00000000 "
                "--insidevercolor=00000000 --linecolor=00000000 "
                "--ringwrongcolor=00000000 --insidewrongcolor=00000000 "

     #+end_src

     I also have to bind an extra key for this function.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-binds
       ("<XF86ScreenSaver>" . desktop-environment-lock-screen)
     #+end_src

**** Screenshots

     This one was the least straightforward because the way it's implemented by
     ~desktop-environment~ is *SUPER* wonky.  Here are the binds:

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-binds
       ("<print>" . farl-de/screenshot-part-clip)
       ("<S-print>" . farl-de/screenshot-clip)
       ("<C-print>" . farl-de/screenshot-part)
       ("<C-S-print>" . farl-de/screenshot)
     #+end_src

     First, I set what directory to store screenshots in.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-vars
       (desktop-environment-screenshot-directory "~/screenshots")
     #+end_src

     Then, I can set the commands for taking a full or partial screenshot and
     saving it to a file.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-vars
       (desktop-environment-screenshot-command
        "FILENAME=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S').png && maim $FILENAME")
       (desktop-environment-screenshot-partial-command
        "FILENAME=$(date +'%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S').png && maim -s $FILENAME")
     #+end_src

     The functions which ~desktop-environment~ comes with are kinda garbage, so I
     made my own to replace them.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref de-init
       (defun farl-de/screenshot ()
         "Take a screenshot and store it in a file."
         (interactive)
         (desktop-environment-screenshot)
         (message "Screenshot saved in ~/screenshots."))

       (defun farl-de/screenshot-part ()
         "Take a capture of a portion of the screen and store it in a file."
         (interactive)
         (desktop-environment-screenshot-part)
         (message "Screenshot saved in ~/screenshots."))

       (defun farl-de/screenshot-clip ()
         "Take a screenshot and put it in the clipboard."
         (interactive)
         (shell-command
          (concat desktop-environment-screenshot-command
                  " && xclip $FILENAME -selection clipboard "
                  "-t image/png &> /dev/null && rm $FILENAME"))
         (message "Screenshot copied to clipboard."))

       (defun farl-de/screenshot-part-clip ()
         "Take a shot of a portion of the screen and put it in the clipboard."
         (interactive)
         (shell-command
          (concat desktop-environment-screenshot-partial-command
                  " && xclip $FILENAME -selection clipboard "
                  "-t image/png &> /dev/null && rm $FILENAME"))
         (message "Screenshot copied to clipboard."))
     #+end_src

*** Setting the wallpaper

    I've been working on [[https://github.com/farlado/emacs-wallpaper][an easy way to configure wallpapers]] which makes for way
    less hassle.  It only relies on ~feh~ as a backend for applying wallpapers, so
    if you use Emacs as a daemon it can manage your wallpapers even if it isn't
    the window manager.  It's on MELPA now!

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (use-package wallpaper
        :ensure t
        :defer t
        :hook ((exwm-randr-screen-change . wallpaper-set-wallpaper)
               (exwm-init . wallpaper-cycle-mode)))
    #+end_src

*** Monitor settings

    Calling ~arandr~ to adjust monitors is useful when I am preparing to present
    something using my computer or need to adjust how monitors are set up in a
    unique way that isn't a preset from my dotfiles.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun monitor-settings ()
        "Open arandr to configure monitors."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Monitor Settings" nil "arandr"))
    #+end_src

*** Network settings

    This one uses two windows: one to open the NetworkManager connection editor,
    and another to list WiFi networks nearby.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun network-settings ()
        "Open a NetworkManager connection editor."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Network Settings" nil "nm-connection-editor")
        (async-shell-command "nmcli dev wifi list" "*Wi-Fi Networks*"))
    #+end_src

*** Volume mixer

    For when you need to do volume mixing.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun volume-settings ()
        "Open pavucontrol to adjust volume."
        (interactive)
        (start-process "Volume Mixer" nil "pavucontrol"))
    #+end_src

*** Audio loop-back

    Used when I play Jackbox Party Pack with friends.  Also set up to launch
    ~pavucontrol~ to set up which programs to pass through to Discord.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun audio-loopback ()
        "Loop desktop audio into a null sink alongside the primary input."
        (interactive)
        (dolist (command
                 '(;; Create null sink `loop'
                   "load-module module-null-sink sink_name=loop"
                   "update-sink-proplist loop device.description=loop"
                   ;; Create null sink `out'
                   "load-module module-null-sink sink_name=out"
                   "update-sink-proplist out device.description=out"
                   ;; Loop `loop' to primary output
                   "load-module module-loopback source=loop.monitor"
                   ;; Pipe it into `out'
                   "load-module module-loopback source=loop.monitor sink=out"
                   ;; Loop primary input into `out'
                   "load-module module-loopback sink=out"))
          (shell-command (concat "pacmd " command)))
        ;; Run `pavucontrol' and then unload the modules after it completes
        (start-process-shell-command
         "Audio Loop" nil (concat "pavucontrol;"
                                  "pacmd unload-module module-null-sink;"

** Keybindings

   Key bindings specifically related to window management or launching X
   applications are all placed in one area to make it easier to manage them.

*** Global binds to use across everything

    Since I'm very lazy and don't feel like writing a whole bunch of lambdas for
    multiple workspaces, presented here are instead some ~mapcar~ calls, like the

                                    ([?\C-s] . [?\C-f])
                                    ([?\C-\/] . [?\C-z])

                                    ;; Other
                                    ([?\C-d] . [delete])
                                    ([?\M-d] . [C-delete])
                                    ([?\C-k] . [S-end delete])
                                    ([?\C-g] . [escape])))
    #+end_src

    Key sequences cannot be defined in =exwm-input-simulation-keys=, so they are
    functions which are called in order to provide the desired behavior.  The
    functions that follow ensure that keys I use in Emacs behave similarly in X
    windows as they do in Emacs itself.

**** =C-s=

     The first is for saving.  Since Emacs uses =C-x C-s= to save, a function has
     to be written to simulate that by pressing =C-q= then =C-s=, to send =C-s=
     verbatim to the X window.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (defun farl-exwm/C-s ()
         "Pass C-s to the EXWM window."
         (interactive)
         (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-q C-s")))
     #+end_src

**** =C-k=

     The next function is one meant to create a link in Telegram and do a number
     of other things in other programs.  It is placed on the same key sequence
     that Org-mode uses to place links: =C-c C-l=.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
       (defun farl-exwm/C-k ()
         "Pass C-k to the EXWM window."
         (interactive)
         (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-q C-k")))
     #+end_src

**** =C-a=

     This function is meant to push =C-a=, which selects all text.  It is bound to
     =C-x h= since that's the equivalent key in Emacs.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-exwm/C-a ()
        "Pass C-a to the EXWM window."
        (interactive)
        (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "C-q C-a")))
     #+end_src

**** "=C-o="

     This function is meant to mimic the behavior =C-o= has in a standard Emacs
     buffer.  It should push what follows onto a new line while staying on the
     current line.

     #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (defun farl-exwm/C-o ()
        "Pass the equivalent of C-o to the EXWM window."
        (interactive)
        (execute-kbd-macro (kbd "<S-return> C-b")))
     #+end_src

**** Binds

     These functions are bound to keys in =exwm-mode-map=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-mode-binds
      ("C-c C-l" . farl-exwm/C-k)
      ("C-x C-s" . farl-exwm/C-s)
      ("C-x h" . farl-exwm/C-a)
      ("C-o" . farl-exwm/C-o)
    #+end_src

*** Send a key verbatim more easily

    This means there's one less key needed to send a verbatim key to an EXWM
    buffer.  It is obviously bound in =exwm-mode-map=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-mode-binds
      ("C-q" . exwm-input-send-next-key)
      ("C-c C-q" . nil)
    #+end_src

*** Keyboard layout selection

    I'm using Emacs as the input handler now, so this should make things a
    little easier to manage... hopefully.  Because of this, =C-\= needs to be
    added to =exwm-input-prefix-keys=.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (push ?\C-\\ exwm-input-prefix-keys)
    #+end_src

*** Inhibit keys I don't use

    This removes the following from =exwm-mode-map=:
    - Toggling fullscreen
    - Toggling floating
    - Toggling hiding
    - Toggling the mode line

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-mode-binds
      ("C-c C-f" . nil)
      ("C-c C-t C-f" . nil)
      ("C-c C-t C-v" . nil)
      ("C-c C-t C-m" . nil)
    #+end_src

** On startup
   :properties:
   :header-args: :noweb-ref on-startup
   :end:

   This is everything that should be started or run when EXWM starts.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :noweb-ref exwm-init
     (defun farl-exwm/on-startup ()
       "Start EXWM and related processes."
       <<on-startup>>)
   #+end_src

   This function is run during =after-init-hook=.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-hooks
     (after-init . farl-exwm/on-startup)
   #+end_src

*** Make Emacs start fullscreen

    This makes Emacs startup look a lot more natural.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (set-frame-parameter nil 'fullscreen 'fullboth)
    #+end_src

*** XDG compliance and WM settings

    I have to set a few environment variables for the sake of compliance with
    various specifications, most notably the XDG Base Directory Specification.
    Also in this block I set an environment variable signaling to Java
    applications that the window manager is not a reparenting window manager.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (setenv "XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP" "emacs")
      (setenv "GTK2_RC_FILES" (expand-file-name "~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkrc"))
      (setenv "QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME" "gtk2")
      (setenv "_JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING" "1")
    #+end_src

*** Disable screen blanking

    I don't need my laptop's screen shutting off just because I'm sitting and
    watching a video with the laptop idle too long.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (start-process "Disable Blanking" nil "xset"
                     "s" "off" "-dpms")
    #+end_src

*** Keyboard configuration

    This block sets the keyboard layout to US and give Caps Lock the
    functionality of Control.  I was hesitant to do this at first, but it's
    significantly more comfortable.  I almost never used caps lock as it is,
    given my keyboards have no indicator for it on my laptops, but this gives me
    a much easier way to do commands without shifting my hand too far.  Ideally,
    however, I configure my keyboards so that this setting is nothing more than
    an afterthought.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (start-process "Keyboard Layout" nil "setxkbmap"
                     "us" "-option" "ctrl:nocaps")
    #+end_src

*** Disable the trackpad

    This thing is disgusting, and I prefer trackpoints way more.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (start-process "Trackpad Setup" nil "xinput"
                     "disable" (shell-command-to-string
                                (concat "xinput | grep Synap | head -n 1 | "
                                        "sed -r 's/.*id=([0-9]+).*/\\1/' | "
                                        "tr '\n' ' ' | sed 's/ //'")))
    #+end_src

*** Start the compositor

    I don't need it, but having basic compositing is very nice.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (start-process "Compositor" nil "xcompmgr")
    #+end_src

*** Set fallback cursor

    Some X windows will have weird cursors if this isn't done.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (start-process "Fallback Cursor" nil "xsetroot"
                     "-cursor_name" "left_ptr")
    #+end_src

*** Banish the mouse

    I've always been mixed on this behavior but it seems like a good idea.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (start-process "Mouse banisher" nil "xbanish")
    #+end_src

*** Notifications

    There is currently still no Emacs based notifications manager that I can
    personally get behind, and I by no means have enough Emacs Lisp know-how to
    properly write such a package.  Because of this, I'm stuck using ~dunst~.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (start-process "Notifications" nil "dunst")
    #+end_src

*** Start EXWM

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle no
      (exwm-enable)
      (exwm-xim-enable)
      (exwm-randr-enable)
      (exwm-systemtray-enable)
    #+end_src

** On logout
   :properties:
   :header-args: :noweb-ref on-logout
   :end:

   When exiting, these are things I want done.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb yes :noweb-ref exwm-init
     (defun farl-exwm/on-logout ()
       "Run this when logging out as part of `kill-emacs-hook'."
       <<on-logout>>)
   #+end_src

   This is hooked into when Emacs is killed.

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :noweb-ref exwm-hooks
     (kill-emacs . farl-exwm/on-logout)
   #+end_src

*** Black out the root window

    This way, it looks good when exiting Emacs.

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp
      (start-process "Root window" nil "hsetroot"
                     "-solid" "'#000000'")
    #+end_src

* Giving files their footers

  Since we gave files their headers, I see no reason not to give them footers.

*** =pdumper.el=

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "pdumper.el"
      

      ;;; pdumper.el ends here
    #+end_src

*** =early-init.el=

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "early-init.el"
      

      ;;; early-init.el ends here
    #+end_src

*** =init.el=

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle "init.el"
      

      ;;; init.el ends here
